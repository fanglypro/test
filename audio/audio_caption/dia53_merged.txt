0.0-1.0 seconds. Really?
3.0-6.0 seconds. In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too.
6.0-7.0 seconds. Man, the moment.
7.0-8.0 seconds. Okay.
10.0-11.0 seconds. Except the day.
11.0-14.0 seconds. So I felt like I needed a couple seconds to get ready.
15.0-17.0 seconds. I'm not going to wait in the moment.
18.0-22.0 seconds. So do you want to kiss again?
